SmoothMoves 2D Skeletal Animation Editor
for use with Unity3D

Copyright 2012 - 2013 echo17


IMPORTANT -- READ FIRST !!!!

If you are upgrading to Unity 4.3 or greater, you will need to import the package "SmoothMoves_Editor_dll_after43" located at the path "Assets/SmoothMoves/Editor/SmoothMoves/". There were some significant changes to Unity's undo system in 4.3 that require a separate editor dll. This package will ensure you have the correct editor files.

If you are upgrading from SmoothMoves v 1.x, please be sure to read the "smoothmoves_v2_upgrade_guide.pdf" by going to the menu "SmoothMoves > Documentation > V2 Upgrade Guide".
